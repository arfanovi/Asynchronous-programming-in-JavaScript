Logic:


* Define Functions:
Person1()
Person2()
Person3()
Person4()


* Function Calls:
Functions Person1, Person2, Person3, and Person4 are called in sequence from top to bottom.

* Instantly Output 
Functions Person1, Person2, and Person4 instantly or Immediately print 

 # but When Person3() is called:
It first immediately prints 'Doe' to the console.
Then, it sets a timer using setTimeout to print 'John' after waiting for 1 second.


* Asynchronous Execution:

 # When Person3() is called:
It first immediately prints 'Doe' to the console.
Then, it sets a timer using setTimeout to print 'John' after waiting for 1 second.
